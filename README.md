# Python Big O Notation


### Constant (O(c))

This denotes an algorithm with constant time complexity, meaning its execution time does not depend on the size of the input. Regardless of the input size, the algorithm takes a constant amount of time to complete.

### Linear (O(n)):
  
Linear time complexity signifies that the algorithm's execution time grows linearly with the size of the input. As the input size increases, the time taken by the algorithm also increases linearly.

### Quadratic (O(n²))
 
Quadratic time complexity implies that the algorithm's execution time grows quadratically with the size of the input. As the input size increases, the execution time increases quadratically, often resulting in slower performance for larger inputs.

### Cubic (O(n³))

Cubic time complexity denotes that the algorithm's execution time grows cubically with the size of the input. As the input size increases, the execution time increases cubically, making it significantly slower for larger inputs compared to linear or quadratic time complexities.

### Exponential (O(2ⁿ)) 

Exponential time complexity indicates that the algorithm's execution time doubles with each addition to the input size. This results in rapidly increasing execution times as the input size grows, making it impractical for large inputs.

### Logarithmic (O(log(n)))

Logarithmic time complexity suggests that the algorithm's execution time grows logarithmically with the size of the input. Despite increases in input size, the algorithm's execution time grows very slowly, making it highly efficient, especially for large datasets.

### Log Linear (O(nlog(n))) 

Logarithmic-linear time complexity combines the growth rates of logarithmic and linear time complexities. It typically arises in algorithms like merge sort and quicksort. While not as efficient as pure logarithmic time complexity, it still provides relatively efficient performance, especially for moderate to large datasets.
